## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Engineering Experience
**Autodidact** _(Aug 2024 - Mar 2025)_
During this period, I learned some things that I hoped to learn, and generated 2 repos as return to the community:
[TA](https://github.com/eeyzs1/TA): TA means trading analysis, this is a repo that explained all functions from talib based on its source code and knowledge about trading analysis by comments.

[foolishr](https://github.com/eeyzs1/foolishr): A repo of web dev with grpc which is a high-performance open-source feature-rich RPC framework for efficient and simple communication between client and server.

**Game developer** @ [4fools1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180460/4fools1/) _(Jan 2024 - July 2024)_
4fools is a 2d game developed by godot engine.
  - Designed, developed and published the whole game the whole game except the art part.
  - Main art resources collected from open free resources, miscellaneous made with Krita.

**Software Engineer** @ [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/) _(Nov 2020 - Nov 2023)_
DALLAS is a distributed test software designed to systematically test the network elements of the core network, and has implemented the simulation of the main network elements of 345G and their core functions.
  - do new features, mainly to develop new functions according to the new requirements from customers
  - solve trouble reports which contains the problems encountered in the process of software usage from internal or external users
  - improve the software, which optimizes and refactor the implementation of software
  - In response to these tasks, I mainly carried out the following actions: (1) Read the documentation, communicate in a timely manner, and understand the real needs of the customer. (2) Analyze the problem with appropriate tools and try to reproduce the problem with as little effort as possible. (3) Review the code, parse the underlying purpose, implement and optimize the code.
    
## üóû Researcher Experience
**Current work** @ [CV_RTS](https://github.com/eeyzs1/CV_RTS) _(Mar 2025 - Present)_
Investigating how four proposed strategies influence the effect of PUGD in terms of perturbation radius and scale of weight. In addition, studying optimal usage timing of PUGD
  - Perturbated Unit Gradient Descent (PUGD) algorithm is one optimizer method that combined the Unit gradient descent(UGD) with Sharpness aware minimization (SAM).
  - This research (CV_RTS) stems from the confusion I encountered while reading the PUGD paper. Specifically, I was puzzled about why unit perturbation radius could yield the optimal loss landscape and the underlying algorithmic conflicts between PUGD and SAM. Additionally, the concept of early stopping inspired me to explore the possibility of identifying an appropriate timing for applying PUGD.
  - In response to these considerations, I proposed four strategies based on cosine annealing to adjust the perturbation radius and weight scale, and investiagted about late launching of PUGD.
  - Experimental results on the tested datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods can enhance the performance of the trained model.
  - Progress has been slowed by limited computing resources, prompting expanded experimental data collection efforts.
